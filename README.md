# NFL_Project
By Nick Furey and Richard Olekanma

Data analytics NFL project

Goal: Find actionable information about how defenses defend against the pass.
Focuses on working with defensive coverage types, presnap motion and offensive formation

Main function.py is used to create the CSV's needed for the analysis. 
The coverage and formation analysis file and the presnap and catch predictor are then run with the data created in the main function.
To run this project the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/data needs to be placed in the same folder as these python files. Then main function.py should be run. After that any of the analysis files can be run
